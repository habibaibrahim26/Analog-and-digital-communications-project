First part implement a MATLAB code to ask the user to enter M signals matrix as its input then 
produce the N basis functions for these signals (only valid till 3 basis functions for 3D representation)
Plotting constellation diagram of signals
Second part calculating the bit error rate of binary data 
that are line coded using binary polar NRZ turning them into polar (encoding) then adding white gaussian noise while transmission with different noise power then sketching the constellation of received signals, Decoding the received signals then plotting a relation between BER and Eb/No.
Lastly Derive theoretically the BER of polar NRZ in terms of Eb/No and plot the 
theoretical BER vs Eb/No (in dB) compare it with the measured results.
